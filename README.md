# airlines_flight_data-analysis-project
Project Overview:
This project explores airline flight pricing and schedules using real-world flight data.
The goal is to uncover patterns in ticket prices, flight schedules, and customer options using Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and data visualization techniques.

Objectives:
-Understand pricing patterns across different airlines and routes.
-Investigate how ticket prices change as the departure date approaches.
-Compare economy vs business class pricing.
-Analyze busiest flight times and routes.

Approach:
1.Data Cleaning & Preparation:
-Removed unused columns and handled missing values.
-Standardized column names for readability.

2.Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
-Analyzed price variations across airlines, routes, and classes.
-Investigated time-based trends in ticket prices.
-Identified busiest airports and peak travel times.

3.Data Visualization:
-Bar plots for departure/arrival frequencies.
-Box plots for price comparisons.
-Line plots for pricing trends over days left.

4.Key Insights:
-Last-minute bookings (1â€“2 days before departure) cost significantly more.
-Business class fares are several times higher than economy.
-Time of day and route choice greatly influence ticket prices.
-Some airlines maintain consistently higher average fares.

5.Tech Stack
-Languages: Python
-Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn
-Environment: Jupyter Notebook
